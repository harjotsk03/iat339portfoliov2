          <p>
            i created study spotr, a
            <span class="highlight-white">full-stack application</span> that
            helps students easily find ideal study spots, whether nearby or
            anywhere around the world. the inspiration came from a common
            problem i and many students face—finding the
            <span class="highlight-white">perfect place to study</span> with the
            right amenities like wifi, power outlets, quiet spaces, and
            whiteboards. with study spotr, users can search for spots by
            location, use an
            <span class="highlight-white"
              >interactive map powered by mapbox</span
            >, or browse a list of study spots to find exactly what they need.
          </p>

          <p>
            each location provides important details, including whether id is
            required, and users can leave ratings and reviews based on their
            experience, ensuring future visitors get accurate feedback. i built
            this project using the
            <span class="highlight-white"
              >mern stack (mongodb, express.js, react.js, and node.js)</span
            >, which allowed me to create a
            <span class="highlight-white"
              >scalable and interactive platform</span
            >. my goal is to grow the app with over
            <span class="highlight-white">100+ active study spots</span> in the
            coming months and make it a useful tool for students everywhere.

          <p>
            building this application has been a highly rewarding experience,
            providing me with valuable insights into
            <span class="highlight-white">full-stack development</span> and the
            intricacies of modern web applications. one major takeaway was the
            importance of securely managing user authentication, particularly
            how to properly store and handle tokens and cookies to ensure both
            security and seamless user experiences. i also learned how to
            effectively troubleshoot
            <span class="highlight-white">cors issues</span>, which often come
            up when working with separate frontend and backend deployments,
            especially when they're hosted on different platforms like vercel
            and render.

        <div class="conclusion-column">
          <h2>key <span class="highlight-orange">takeaways</span></h2>
          <p>
            deploying the app across these platforms taught me the significance
            of configuring
            <span class="highlight-white">environment variables</span> correctly
            and ensuring smooth integration between services. i gained a deeper
            understanding of how to manage
            <span class="highlight-white">session persistence</span> and refresh
            tokens for a more user-friendly experience. additionally, dealing
            with <span class="highlight-white">deployment challenges</span>,
            such as optimizing performance for server-side rendering and
            addressing scalability, helped me appreciate the complexities of
            hosting and maintaining a live application. overall, this project
            enhanced my technical skills and reinforced the importance of
            planning for
            <span class="highlight-white"
              >security, scalability, and user experience</span
            >
            from the very beginning.
