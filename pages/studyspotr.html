          <h2>the <span class="highlight-green">problem</span></h2>
          <p>
            students frequently encounter a common challenge: finding the
            perfect study spot. they often struggle to locate places that meet
            their specific needs—whether it's having access to
            <span class="highlight-white"
              >wi-fi, power outlets, or a quiet environment</span
            >
            to focus. additionally, before starting this project, i faced my own
            challenge of not having built a
            <span class="highlight-white"
              >fully hosted full-stack application</span
            >
            accessible to real users, making this development journey a valuable
            learning experience.

          <p>
            building this application has been a highly rewarding experience,
            providing me with valuable insights into
            <span class="highlight-white">full-stack development</span> and the
            intricacies of modern web applications. through implementing
            features like
            <span class="highlight-white">real-time location updates</span> and
            <span class="highlight-white">interactive mapping</span>, I gained
            hands-on experience with modern web technologies. one major takeaway
            was the importance of securely managing user authentication,
            particularly how to properly store and handle tokens and cookies to
            ensure both security and seamless user experiences. working with the
            MapBox API taught me crucial lessons about
            <span class="highlight-white">API integration</span> and
            <span class="highlight-white">data optimization</span>. i also
            learned how to effectively troubleshoot
            <span class="highlight-white">cors issues</span>, which often come
            up when working with separate frontend and backend deployments,
            especially when they're hosted on different platforms like vercel
            and render.

          <h2>key <span class="highlight-orange">takeaways</span></h2>
          <p>
            deploying the app across these platforms taught me the significance
            of configuring
            <span class="highlight-white">environment variables</span> correctly
            and ensuring smooth integration between services. implementing
            <span class="highlight-white">user authentication</span> and
            <span class="highlight-white">authorization systems</span> deepened
            my understanding of web security best practices. i gained expertise
            in managing
            <span class="highlight-white">session persistence</span> and refresh
            tokens for a more user-friendly experience. the project also taught
            me about
            <span class="highlight-white">database optimization</span> and
            <span class="highlight-white">query performance</span> when dealing
            with location-based data. additionally, dealing with
            <span class="highlight-white">deployment challenges</span>, such as
            optimizing performance for server-side rendering and addressing
            scalability, helped me appreciate the complexities of hosting and
            maintaining a live application. implementing
            <span class="highlight-white">error handling</span> and
            <span class="highlight-white">logging systems</span> proved
            essential for maintaining and debugging the application. overall,
            this project enhanced my technical skills and reinforced the
            importance of planning for
            <span class="highlight-white"
              >security, scalability, and user experience</span
            >
            from the very beginning.
